Simple comments powered by [Firebase](http://firebase.com). 
Some assembly required.

- [ ] `git init; git add .; git commit -m 'first commit'`
- [ ] CommentView#mine() needs real implementation
- [ ] adding or removing comments must be accompanied 
      by incrementing/decrementing the counter
- [ ] css -> stylus
- [ ] refactor default-avatar as simply avatar and put the logic in there
- [ ] real Makefile
- [ ] computed (view-only) properties aren't reactive
- [ ] sort comments (newest/oldest)
- [ ] limit comments fetched (to like 25 or something)
- [ ] upvote/downvote
- [ ] styles:
  - [ ] style tool buttons (like delete)
  - [ ] style loading indicator
  - [ ] textarea replace with contenteditable and restyle
- [ ] threaded reply
- [ ] pin down dependency versions
